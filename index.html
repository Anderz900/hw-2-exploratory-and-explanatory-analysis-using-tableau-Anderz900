        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
                The importance of marketing in today’s capitalistic society is undebated. The key to successful marketing is simply 
                understanding who the target market is. Therefore, there exists many strategies where the consumers tendencies can be evaluated. In fact, it
                is difficult to identify a successful
                marketing strategy because each every customer has different demands and there are often many different
                features which affect customer behavior. Sometimes it seems like an impossible challenge with the innumerous variables
                to take in to account- which is when visualization takest the wheel. This project deals with a dataset containing information from a Portugese bank’s direct
                telemarketing campaign, which includes data about the customer and how the customer was contacted. The goal is to see which features could 
                best be visualized in order to better ascertain how to get more people to invest in the bank itself.

            <h2> Data Selection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Having had experience working with datasets before I knew what I wanted to look for. Since I've also 
                worked with business analytics, I found the dataset setting a familiar tone and cleaning the data 
                was probably the easiest thing to do since I have a solid grasp on Python. I only combined all levels 
                of basic education (high school at most) into one column called 'basic', and I also replaced all instances
                of the 'pdays' column that had 999 with 0. This was because while it is supposed to describe the last time the bank
                contacted the customer, it would make more neutral sense to have that value be 0 instead of something as 
                offsetting as the large number 999. The end result of the data facilitated my data visualization analysis. The following
                cleaned dataset contains 10 columns of numerical data and 11 columns of categorical data.

            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I really enjoyed manipulating Tableau in order to achieve insightful graphs. One visualization was a bit 
                too simplistic and did not really give one enough to think about. It was based on whether the marital
                relationship of indiviudals mattered. I also used the 'Y' ("yes" indicated he/she is a subscriber to the bank) to 
                check if married couples could prove a useful visualization. However, I then thought it would be better to do 
                something where for example I check on how often people would take loans and compared that with their age, which
                surely, as can be seen above in the dashboard, produces results with more information. So, anyways one can see the
                 decent attempt at visualizing the data below.

            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I actually wanted to combine both the story structure on the Euribor Rate graph and then mesh that into a 
                dashboard alongside the rest of the graphs. However, I could not figure out how to do that so I instead opted out 
                for having nice symmetry (with color) with both the scatterplot and bar graphs on the right. I believed this was the much
                better option because it created stability and beauty into the design. In addition, I think it is worth discussing 
                my favorite graphs to avoid confusion. The scatterplot implies higher subscription with less than 5 calls as the data portrays
                the more dense "yes" area ocurring below the constant 5 line. The Euribor rate is akin to the Libor (London
                Interbank Rate) and is the rate at which banks in Europe lend to each other. The Euribor
                rate is also similar in effect to the Federal Funds Rate in America but is computed differently. Evidently, the annotations
                in the graph tell the rest of the story. Lastly, as the bar graph on the right has been taking data over the same time period,
                the percentage of people who said "yes" compared to "no" is analogous to describing the rate of growth. It is highly important therefore
                to understand that students could be a major source of clientele in the future. It is also worth noting that the ordering of the 
                elements in the legend plays a huge part in displaying data. Below, one can see the drastic effects on clarity it can have by emphasizing 
                "no" over "yes".
